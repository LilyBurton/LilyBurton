<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>My past work experience has been focused on communicating with customers, both on the phone and in person. During my free time, I'm a bit more introverted; I love to read, write, play video games, stream on Twitch, and watch TV shows. I constantly love to explore and learn new things, particularly within technology, and I found that keen sense of exploration through software development. It allows me to express my creativity through frontend development, use my brain for problem-solving, and experiment by creating applications. Every day is always a new adventure.</p>

<h1>My Skills</h1>

<h3>Willingness to Learn</h3>
<p>As a junior developer, I am fully committed to continuously learning, developing, and growing in many ways so I can explore different technologies, methodologies, and languages. I'm always eager to enhance my skills. My time at Makers Bootcamp helped me start my journey as a developer and find ways to expand my knowledge within the world of technology by taking various courses, communicating with other developers to understand the tech world, creating projects through research, and attending workshops and events to understand different technologies and industry trends.</p>

<h3>Communicate</h3>
<p>I have demonstrated strong communication skills, which have become essential when interacting with other developers. In my previous retail position, I regularly interacted with customers, resolving their issues and ensuring a positive experience. This role honed my ability to convey information clearly and empathetically. Additionally, during the Makers Bootcamp, I worked on several group projects where effective communication was crucial. For example, while developing FlavourFinder, our final group project, we organized morning stand-ups, pair programming, and evening retros to ensure the team was up to date with tasks, worked together to deal with errors and blockers, and checked in on everyone to see how they felt about their progress. My ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders is a strength I bring to any team.</p>

<h1>Hobbies outside of Coding</h1>

<h3>Streaming</h3>
<p>During my spare time, I love to stream video games on Twitch, where I build a community with people who share similar interests and communicate with viewers on the stream. This helps me become confident in communicating with people and find comfort in speaking in my own voice.</p> 
<h4>Favourite Videogames</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Spyro the Dragon</li>
  <li>The Sims series</li>
  <li>Belatro</li>
  <li>Tekken Series</li>
  <li>Crash Bandicoot Series</li>
</ul>

<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>I find going out for a walk to be important for getting fresh air and sunlight, which helps energize me for the day. As someone who loves being in front of the computer, it's important for me to practice holistic wellness and take care of myself by taking breaks from technology so I can return to work with a fresh mind.</p> 

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>One thing I love to do to relax is writing stories. Writing gives me immense joy and is also a continuous learning experience where I can express my ideas, thoughts, and creativity. Seeing my thoughts and ideas written on paper and constantly progressing is a huge accomplishment. It also helps me enhance my vocabulary, sharpen my analytical skills, and broaden my knowledge of various topics.</p>

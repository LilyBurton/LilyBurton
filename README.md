<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>My past work experience has been focused on communicating with customers, on both phone and in person. During my free time, I'm a bit more introverted where I love to read, write, play videogames, including streaming on Twitch and watch TV shows. I constantly love to explore and learn new things, particularly within technology and I found that keen sense of exploring through software development, where I can explore my creativity through frontend, using my brain for problem solving and experiment what I can do by creating applications. Everyday is always a new adventure.</p>

<h1>My Skills</h1>

<h3>Willingness to Learn</h3>
<p>As a junior developer, I am fully committed to continuously learn, develop and grow and many ways so I can explore different technologies, methodologies and languages and I'm always eager to enhance my skills. My time at Makers Bootcamp helped me started my journey as a developer and helped me find ways to expand my knowledge within the world of technology by doing various courses, communicate with other developers to understand the world of tech, creating projects through research and attending to workshops and events to understand different technologies and learn about the industry trends.</p>

<h3>Communicate</h3>
<p>I have deonstrated strong communications that has learned it has become essential when communicating with other developers. In my previous position in retail, I regularly interact with customers, resolving their issues and giving them a positive experience. This role honed my ability to convey information clearly and empathetically. Additionally, during the Makers Bootcamp, I worked on several group projects where effective communication was essential. For example, while developing FlavourFinders, our final group project, we organized morning stand-ups, pair programming, and evening retros to ensure the team members are up to date with the tasks, working together to deal with errors and blockers and check in on everyone to see how they feel about their progress. My ability to communicate effectively, both with technical and non-technical stakeholders, is a strength I bring to any team.</p>

<h3>Adaptability</h3>
<p>Thanks to my previous experience, adaptability has become my greatest strength where I be able to adapt in fast-paced environment. In just 16 weeks in Makers Bootcamp, I have been able to learn new programming languages, technologies and frameworks to meet the needs of my projects and continuously evolving my knowledge. For example, during my experience in Bootcamp I have become interested in the MERN stack to understand React and routing it to express and node so that it will be able to connect to Mongo.db. With these skills I would be able to learn new JavaScript frameworks such as TypeScript and how to integrate them into my projects.</p>


<h1>Hobbies outside of Coding</h1>

<h3>Streaming</h3>
<p>During my spare time, I love to stream videogames on Twitch where I make a community with people that shares similar interests and be able to communicate with viewers on the stream. This helps become confident in communicating with people and find comfort and speaking in my own voice.</p> 
<h4>Favourite Videogames</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Spyro the Dragon</li>
  <li>The Sims series</li>
  <li>Belatro</li>
  <li>Tekken Series</li>
  <li>Crash Bandicoot Series</li>
</ul>

<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>I do find going out for a walk to be important in a daily life to get fresh air and sunlight that helps me energise for the day. As someone who loves to be in front of the computer, it's important for me do holistic wellness to take care of myself by taking a break from technology so i would be able to go back to work with a fresh mind.</p> 

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>One thing I love to do to relax is writing stories. Writing stories gives me immense joys but it also a continuous learning experience where I'll be able to express my ideas, thoughts and creativity. Seeing my thoughts and ideas been written on paper and constantly progressed through out is a huge accomplishment while also helping me to enhance my vocabulary, sharpen my analytical skills and also broadens my knowledge of various of topics.</p>

<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>My past work experience has been focused on communicating with customers, on both phone and in person. During my free time, I'm a bit more introverted where I love to read, write, play videogames, including streaming on Twitch and watch TV shows. I constantly love to explore and learn new things, particularly within technology and I found that keen sense of exploring through software development, where I can explore my creativity through frontend, using my brain for problem solving and experiment what I can do by creating applications. Everyday is always a new adventure.</p>
